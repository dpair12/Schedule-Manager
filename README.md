# Schedule-Manager
This a time management application that I created using JavaScript. Note that I only contributed to the application's functionality, html and css were premade files that I was provided with from Coding BootCamp. 

# Project-Description
This project is a representation of what I learned so far with jQuery UI and Day.js. Using the ReadME for Challenge 5, I created this project to perform the following functions:

Created a JavaScript File that is linked to the provided HTML document.
In the JavaScript File, I created a function to have the current day and time displayed in the header section. 
In the JavaScript File, I created a function to store user inputs into local storage when save button is clicked in.
In the JavaScript File, I created a function to have the styling of blocks automatically update based on the time of day it is.
In the JavaScript File, I created a function to ensure user inputs are still displayed after a page is refreshed.
In the HTML document, I created ids for the time of day, user input field, and more.
